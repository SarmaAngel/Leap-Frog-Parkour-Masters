For this project, when I was fixing and trying to make it more enjoyable, I added and fixed a few things. I added in some unique jumping spots, increased the jump variable to 6f, made it so player one stops when the movement buttons are not pressed, got rid of the infinite jump, and made it so the players face the way they are moving.
The Design Tools that I used were Goal and Constraint. For Goal, I made collectibles that appear around the map every 30 seconds. These also give players points, so they can try to collect all of these to increase their points in the game. For Constraint, I added a timer. The timer makes it so the game lasts for 4 minutes, once time it up it add the points from jumping over the other player and the collectibles for each player, tells them the points for each, and calculates who the winner is.
